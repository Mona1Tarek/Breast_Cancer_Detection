# Breast Cancer Detection - Neural Networks for Classification

## Project Description

This project aims to build a neural network model for detecting breast cancer based on medical diagnostic data. Early and accurate detection of breast cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes, and machine learning models, particularly neural networks, have shown promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy. The project focuses on developing a binary classifier that predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using diagnostic features from breast cancer datasets.

### Key Components:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the data into training, validation, and test sets.
2. **Neural Network Model Development**: Designing and training a neural network model for binary classification, with a focus on optimizing performance for early detection of breast cancer.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the neural networkâ€™s performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to ensure reliable and accurate predictions.
